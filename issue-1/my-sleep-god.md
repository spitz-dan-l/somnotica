Every night I listen for that rap on the door.<br/>
Even my dog seems no longer a guardian more faithful than my own will.<br/>
My limbs are heavy with temptation, nose damp with neglect,<br/>
and neck exposed.

He knocks only when my curtains are drawn tightly against my bare skin,<br/>
making it safe for him to enter that placid pool in the far depths of my mindâ€™s eye.<br/>
He bathes in it, standing knee deep in that water like a white horse,<br/>
or a swan whose wings are finally tucked in, after a long day of battle and barter. 

I sit behind the curtain, awaiting the transmission between my ego and his demon.<br/>
He tells me I cannot look, I cannot listen to him bathe, that I must trust only my third and fourth eyes,<br/>
(or else he will not kiss me that night).

I wonder if he knows that I feel his skin, the washing of suds and water slipping off his skin, underneath my own. (I take my shirt off before entering my bed.)<br/>
I feel his nakedness as mine. I crave his thin and buttery fingertips,<br/>
feel his crane-like neck graze my navel, and long strands of hair tie knots around my limbs. 

When I am no longer looking with even the goosebumps peppered along my skin, 
he pulls me into him.<br/>
He shoves my head into that purple pool of twilight and moondust, that glitters with heavyweight mineral scales.<br/>
My oppression feels the same as that which beats in the hearts of overcome mermaids. 

He fits us into that underwater elevator which takes only our bodies, raw,<br/>
not even the space of air in our lungs.<br/>
My heartbeat, my breath move per his likeness.<br/>
My hair sways more freely in that water than any other I know. 

I try to dive without resistance,<br/>
into that cenote of sacrificial fatigue,<br/>
Like the many mermaids of me, before me,<br/>
As we pass sublingually beneath his hands,<br/>
As he kisses our wounds, again and again.

I am defragmented, into a shuffled rolodex,<br/>
The me of twilight, the me of octopus ink,<br/>
And the water settles me,<br/>
Like the tea leaves at the bottom of a cup,<br/>
Like the sieve which sorts through debris,<br/>
Like the needle which makes fishnets from disorder,<br/>
And the probe which pulls objects from the dark.

Suddenly and somewhere, eventually, I am released,<br/>
My body rebubbles, fins afloat on the shore of wakefulness.<br/>
My mental fascia are relieved from their prolonged duty,<br/>
as the connective tissue of conscious existence.

Somehow it is me, still me.<br/>
The sleep god has taken care of all the bartering,<br/>
And my water is clearer today.
